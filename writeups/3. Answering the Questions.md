Ok so the procedure is simple

1) For each language, use glob to select only files written in that language.
2) For each file, parse the file using tree-sitter
3) Traverse the tree and answer each question

Hopefully I can just use the same code to traverse the tree for each language. However, I highly doubt that is an option. I'm sure I will be able to reuse quite a bit of the code going from language to language.

Anyway, let's begin with Java since that's the language these questions were originally designed for.

On one hand, our glob statement could be `repos/Java/**/*.java` to only select .java files in the Java folder. On the other hand, we could do `repos/**/*.java` to pick up any Java files that might be in the other repos we cloned. Even though this might net us a few more files to sample data from, it this will do is slow us down heavily due to having to recursively search an additional 2,000 repos. I will go with `repos/Java/**/*.java`.

First things first, let's see how many .java files we have.

```py
from glob import glob

print(len(glob('repos/Java/**/*.java', recursive=True)))
```
The answer is `331336`. That's a pretty decent sample size. On average, that's 331 Java files per repo. That's surprisingly high. Let's see the distribution on file counts.

Quite a few repos with thousands of Java files. I suspect they're importing entire libraries.

Anyway, let's start by parsing a file with tree-sitter.

_By the way, I gave up on glob and just used os.walk because holy cannoli was I having an annoying problem_

Here's the code I got to work with tree-sitter. By the way we must use version `tree-sitter==0.21.3`

```py
import os
from tree_sitter_languages import get_parser, get_language

parser = get_parser('java')

for root, dirs, files in os.walk('repos\\Java'):
	for file in files:
		if file.endswith('.java'):
			with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'rb') as f:
				src = f.read()
				tree = parser.parse(src)
				cur = tree.walk()

				print(cur.node.sexp())
				exit()
```

The output is the S-expression of the file.
