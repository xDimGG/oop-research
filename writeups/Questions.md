Frequency of data types used in parameters, local variables, and members of classes:

                Raw counts and percentage of primitive vs composite types

                                Break down composite to enum, JRE class, “homemade” class

                Raw counts and percentage of each of the primitive types

Raw counts and distributions of number of parameters a method requires

Raw counts and distributions of lines in methods:

                Constructors

                Accessors/mutators

                Static Methods

                Instance Methods

Raw counts and distributions of number of methods in a class

Raw counts and distributions of number of members in a class

Raw counts and distributions of number of member permissions in a class

Raw counts and distributions of number of classes that use inheritance, interfaces, both, neither.

Raw counts and distributions of number of method calls in a method:

                Recursive

                Non-recursive

Frequency of methods that throw exceptions

                Generic (Exception)

                JRE defined exceptions

                Custom exceptions

Frequency of methods that catch exceptions

                Generic (Exception)

                JRE defined exceptions

                Custom exceptions

Raw counts and distributions of if/while/for/enhanced for/case blocks

Raw counts and distributions of constants used in methods

                How many constants are outside of the range of +/- 32?

                How many constants both inside and outside of the range are used w/in a method?

                Count FINAL as a constant, if you can (that may be really hard)
